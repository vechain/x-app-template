 * - Added proposalStartRound() to get the round when the proposal should become active
 * - Added canProposalStartInNextRound() to check if the proposal can start in the next allocation round
 * - Added new state `DepositNotMet` to ProposalState enum
 * - Added depositThreshold() to get the minimum required deposit for a proposal and removed proposalThreshold
