/**
 * @dev Interface of the distribution allocation voting for the x-allocation pool reward distributions.
 * This interface was forked from OpenZeppelin's IGovernor.sol and modified to fit the needs of a voting mechanism
 * where a user can vote on multpile x-apps belonging to the ecosystem and fractionalize their votes accross the x-apps.
 *
 * There can be only one round per time.
 * After the round is created  it becomes immediately active.
 * There can be only two possible outcomes of a round: it succeeds or it fails.
 * To succeed the only requirement is that the quorum is reached.
 *
 * New allocation rounds can be started only by the Emissions contract, this way we can align the duration
 * of emission cycles and allocation rounds.
 *
 * If the round fails, we will need to “finalize” it, which means we will create a pointer to the last succeeded round
 * where shares should be calculated. Anyone can finalize the failed round,
 * but it will be automatically done when a new round starts.

   * key-value pairs that each describe one aspect, for example `support=bravo&quorum=for,abstain`.
   *
   * There are 2 standard keys: `support` and `quorum`.
   *
   * - `support=bravo` refers to the vote options 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain, as in `GovernorBravo`.
   * - `support=x-allocations` refers to the fractionalized vote for each x-application.
   * - `quorum=bravo` means that only For votes are counted towards quorum.
   * - `quorum=for,abstain` means that both For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum.
   * - `quorum=auto` means that the contract defines the logic for counting the quorum.
   *
   * If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params` key with a unique
   * name that describes the behavior. For example:
   *
   * - `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between for/against/abstain.
   * - `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.
   *
   * NOTE: The string can be decoded by the standard
   * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams[`URLSearchParams`]
